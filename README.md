## FPGA
FPGAs are known for their flexibility and ability to be reconfigured to perform any digital func- tion, making them ideal for a wide range of applications in engineering. The use of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) such as the MAX10Lite in our design offers a number of significant advantages. Historically, FPGAs were introduced in the 1980s as a solution to reduce the time and cost asso- ciated with designing custom integrated circuits. Since then, their popularity has grown tremen- dously, especially in signal processing, telecommunications, and, more recently, robotics engineering applications. The project shown here aims to realize a radio-controlled vehicle driven through the DE10-Lite board.
## Vehicle design
The project wants to emphasize the boardâ€™s ability to execute processes suitable for control in a parallel manner. Specifically, it is intended to design a vehicle with two steered wheels on the front axle and two driven wheels on the rear axle.
