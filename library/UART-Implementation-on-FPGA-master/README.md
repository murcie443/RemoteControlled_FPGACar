# UART-Implementation-on-FPGA
The Universal Asynchronous Receiver -Transmitter (UART) is a hardware device utilized for asynchronous serial communication between 
electronic devices. It obtains each byte (8 parallel bits) of data and converts it into a series of bits which are transmitted 
in a sequential manner. The objective was to implement a UART using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and achieve 
half -duplex communication between two such UARTs. The device was tested using the test bench and the timing diagrams 
were obtained successfully.
